For me, Number 2, "Put in the Hard Hours," will likely be the most challenging step for me to overcome. This is because I spend a long time in my commutes to and from work, which is compiled with my ability to learn fast. I can overcome the commute to an extent by doing coursework on the busses and trains, as well as using spare time at work toward course work. As for my fast learning, the reason this is a problem is that i often learn something fast, then overthink it because I don't trust that I properly learned/completed a task, and then end up digging myself into an unnecessary, time-consuming hole. I think it would be best for me to step back and take a breather before I overthink something and doubt my own skills.
